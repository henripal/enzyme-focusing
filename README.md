# Enzyme Focusing Project

This is the code and results for the enzyme focusing project.

## Simulation and modeling.

The simulation code is in `/src/`.

The simulation can be run using the `run_analysis.py` script.

The figures from the paper can be generated using the `plot.py` script.

## Data analysis and figure generation.

All data analysis starts with raw data from Penn State stored in `/data`.

Each notebook in `/notebooks` and `/rev_notebooks` corresponds to a figure;
each notebook processes the data, runs statistical analysis, and saves the
figure in `/img`. No extra steps beyond running the notebook are necessary.
